% About transgender
The dictionary defines transgender as a person whose gender identity differs 
from the sex the person had or was identified as having at birth 
\cite{transgender-def}.

Transgender is a broad term. There are many identities under it. Some examples are 
binary trans-man, binary trans-woman, trans-feminine nonbinary, and trans-masculine 
nonbinary.
