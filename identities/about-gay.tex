% About Gays
The term gay has a little more complex meaning. For example, the dictionary 
defines it as of, relating to, or characterized by sexual or romantic 
attraction to people of one's same sex, usually referring to males 
\cite{gay-def}. It also says of, relating to, or intended for people who are 
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, etc \cite{gay-def}. Therefore gay doesnâ€™t 
just refer to one group.
