# MSU Stories of the Pride
The purpose of this document is to capture stories of LGBTQ+ individuals at 
Montana State University (MSU). It is meant to serve as a time capsule of sorts 
for LGBTQ+ students and the community at MSU. One hope is future students can 
look back and see how their community has changed over time. The stories are 
not required to meet any standards; there are no assigned topics nor length 
limit. Participants wrote about what is meaningful to them and their personal 
experiences. If you wish to read a current copy of our stories with no assembly 
required, feel free to download main.pdf (my logic behind committing the pdf 
file).
