I started to figure out my sexuality around the age of 12. I was very worried 
because I was raised very Christian and I knew my mom wouldn’t approve. After 
about a year and a half of working on accepting myself, I decided to come out 
to my mom. As expected, she didn’t take it very well. After a couple months of 
new strict rules, being banned from seeing my best friend, and ultimately being 
punished for being queer, she elected to pretend it wasn’t true. She never 
acknowledged it again. Fast forward about 4 years, my mom is now engaged to a 
woman. Don’t get me wrong I love my mom and my step mom, but she put me through 
so much pain and now she’s denying it ever happened.
