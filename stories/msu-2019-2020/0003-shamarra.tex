\section*{Shamarra Hardeman:}
After discovering my Not So StraightTM identity in my second year I started 
frequenting the Queer Straight Alliance every week. The president at the time, 
Jamie, introduced the game Warewolf to the group. I thought it was a great 
bonding experience for the local queers, and it was easy to build a lot of 
strong connections and friendships through this game for me. So the following 
year once they had left I decided I wanted to start running these games more 
often in qsa just after the meeting. It's a lot of crazy stories of betrayal, 
trust, and friendship and I think it's absolutely amazing! At this point that 
was two years ago now and we have a tradition of doing it at the end of almost 
every meeting and then we go to IHOP and talk to the amazing waitress and hang 
out there for an hour or two. I guess it's not just one story, but I've seen 
this continuing event bring people out of their bubbles and create strong 
friendships that have lasted and I really enjoy it!
