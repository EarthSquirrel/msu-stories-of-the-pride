\section*{Anonymous: Pick and Choose}
I had a conservative upbringing wherein the idea of being binary was inherent
and somewhat drilled into us, children. Those were the underpinnings of a 
culture I had to take a hiatus from, when I came to America at 17 and my entire 
foundation of navigating identities was dismantled by my engagement at MSU. I 
starting questioning but that only made me increasingly frustrated, as I had a 
conflict brewing inside me. At this time, a close friend of mine and a member 
of the MSU LGBTQ+ community told me something, that changed my entire 
perspective on having an intersectional identity. He said," You need to pick 
and choose a person to love, not a gender" and that defined the rest of my 
experience at MSU.
