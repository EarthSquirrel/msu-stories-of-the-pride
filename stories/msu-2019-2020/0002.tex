\story{Britney}{Finally, a Realization}
{I never realized my sexual identity and now that I have, I’m much happier. 
The signs were all there, I even joked about being a lesbian or told it to 
guys when I didn’t want to go on dates. Turns out it was true! Basically, long 
story short, my best friend in Bozeman moved and I was lonely. I was 22 and for
the first time started to consider that maybe I wanted a relationship. Shortly 
after a guy asked me out. Now I’ve never been attracted to a guy in my life, 
but I said yes. I assumed that’s how it was for all people. The funny thing is 
I had been attracted to girls in the past, I just never realized what that was 
either. This guy and I had been dating for a while when I began to realize I 
was in love with a friend from high school. Shortly before things ended with 
him, I reached out to her. I told myself we were just friends. She ended up 
being my first kiss. Another long story short, she ended up breaking my heart. 
However, I realized something valuable. Turns out, I was not straight; I am a 
lesbian! I started looking into dating girls and getting involved in the MSU 
LGBTQ+ community. There I found a wonderful group of friends and encouraging 
community. All in all, I am so thankful I was able to meet these people and 
explore my identity with them. It’s been an interesting, amazing ride!}
